Student: Peter Warren

Each Jupyter notebook is contained in its own folder. A api_keys.py file is also contained in each folder.

The appropriate API key will need to be added to the api_key.py file in each folder for each notebook.
Replace the text "Your Key Here" with the proper API key.

A third folder, output_data is in the same directory as the other two folders.
Images generated by the notebooks will be saved to this folder.
